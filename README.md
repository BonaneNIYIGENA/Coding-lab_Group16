Hospital Data Monitoring &amp; Archival System

The Hospital "Data Monitoring & Archival System" is a project designed to manage simulated hospital data. It used Python scripts to generate real-time
patient health metrics and resource usage logs. These logs are then managed by Bash scripts, which can interactively archive old data with timestamps and
create new log files. Anothe bash script analyzes the collected data, counting device occurrences and extracting key timestamps, with results appended to
analytical reports. This system demostrates proficiency in shell scripting, log file processing, and data analysis using standard Linux command-line tool.
